For linux debian (xubuntu tested) users there is a fully functional version. You need to download this project, extract and run "files app". For others:
- install Python (version 3.9 or higher)
- install PySimpleGUI (https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installing-pysimplegui)
- install Send2Trash (https://pypi.org/project/Send2Trash/)
- download this project and extract
- launch via command line "python files.py" in the project folder
- optional, you can make executable file for different OS, if use "pyinstaller" (https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

This program is one of my teaching projects.
