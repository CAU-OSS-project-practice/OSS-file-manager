For linux debian (xubuntu tested) users there is a fully functional versions in files "files app" and "files tk app"(Tkinter), which is enough to download and run. For others:
- install Python (v3.9 or higher)
- install PySimpleGUI (https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installing-pysimplegui)
- install Tkinter (https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)
- install Send2Trash (https://pypi.org/project/Send2Trash/)
- download this project and extract
- launch via command line "python files.py" (or "files_tk.py") in the project folder
- optional, you can make executable file for different OS, if use "pyinstaller" (https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

This program is one of my teaching projects.
